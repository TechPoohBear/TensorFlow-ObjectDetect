# TensorFlow-ObjectDetect

This application was designed to be easy to use and supports multiple languages, including Dart, Ruby, Swift, and Kotlin. The repository includes pre-trained models for object detection, as well as tools for training your own models on custom datasets.

## Getting started

To get started with TensorFlow-ObjectDetect, you'll need to have TensorFlow installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file for your preferred language to start using the API.

## Pre-trained models

The repository includes pre-trained models for object detection on the COCO dataset, as well as models trained on other datasets such as Kitti and Open Images. You can download these models and use them for inference on your own images or videos.

## Training your own models

If you want to train your own object detection models on custom datasets, TensorFlow-ObjectDetect provides tools to help you do so. You can use the included scripts to convert your data into the TFRecord format used by TensorFlow, and then train your model using the provided config files.
